    <h1>My 2nd Year Coding Showcase</h1>
	
	<h2>Individual Python Project - The Percent-inator</h2>
	
	<p>		<br> At the end of first year, I was introduced to python. So after a while of messing around with it, I had learned most of the basics: <b>print(), input, sleep and while True</b>. We were told we had to create a project using what we had learned so far in python, and that would be useful to us, as students.

	<br><br>I brainstormed by myself and I decided I would make a python program that would give me the percent and grade I got in a test, and all I would have to do is input the score I got and the total marks. It took a bit of maths, and when I knew I had the code right, I made it look better by adding in links to GIFs that reflected the score and grade you got. 

	<br><br>I encountered only one difficulty when coding this project: Up to this point, I was using IDLE on the computer to write my python code, but this could not open a browser window. I asked my teacher for help, and he guided me to an app called Pythonista, which could open a browser window. I used this to make my project work, and it ran smoothly and made it easy to code.

	<h2>Group Python Project - The Fridge-inator</h2>
	
	<p><br>In second year, our knowledge of python had grown, so much so that we were able to work in groups to create and code a project together. I worked in a group of five, which some would argue is too large for a coding group, but we communicated a lot and often, which meant that everyone knew what they had to do and what other people had to do. We set time limits for when to get certain pieces of code completed, which was effective because we didn’t run over time.  

	<br><br>In this project, we worked together to code a fridge. The user would type in what products were in the fridge and their quantities. Later, we introduced an interactive part of the fridge, which, when prompted, would supply the recipe for a meal, and then inform the user if you had all the products in the fridge. In order to successfully collaborate and join our individual pieces of code, we used Github. I created a repository and invited everyone in my group. I made sure that we read through each other’s code for errors, and marked their code accordingly. With each new file we created, we branched it off, reviewed it, fixed it and then joined it back into the master branch, which was what the finished version of the code would look like. These new branches are called commits. On Github, the amount of commits that are made by different people within a repository is recorded. Here is a link to our Github repository  and a link to the network data which shows the commits to the master branch made by each individual in the group:
